# Database-Design-SQL-Applications
This repository contains all three assignments developed for the MSc course Database Design and Usage.
The projects progressively explore database design, SQL querying, and the integration of databases with web applications using Python.

Exercise 1 – Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Design of a complete E-R diagram in MySQL Workbench for a movie database (“Movie Star”), including entities, attributes, and relationships based on a given scenario.

Exercise 2 – SQL Queries:
Implementation of complex SQL queries on the movies database, focusing on joins, aggregations, and advanced filtering using pure SQL syntax and relational algebra concepts.

Exercise 3 – Python Web Application:
Development of a three-tier web app (frontend, Python backend, MySQL database) using the Bottle framework.
The app executes database operations such as updating movie ranks, retrieving actor collaborations, and computing actor influence graphs.

This series of assignments provided hands-on experience in database modeling, query optimization, and web-based data interaction.
